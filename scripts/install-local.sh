#
# Why this exists. Two things pollute the LaunchServices database on every
# `npm run tauri build`, and both make duplicate entries show up in Launchpad,
# Spotlight and Open With:
#
#   1. bundle_dmg.sh mounts a scratch volume at /Volumes/dmg.XXXXXX while it
#      builds the image. macOS registers the app inside it. The mount is
#      normally ejected, but the registration stays forever - and if a build is
#      interrupted the mount stays too, which then makes the NEXT build's
#      bundle step fail outright.
#   2. The build output itself, target/release/bundle/macos/<app>, is a second
#      real copy of the app on disk and is registered like any other.
#
# So: eject leftovers first, build, install, then unregister everything that is
# not /Applications.

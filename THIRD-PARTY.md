# Third-party notices

Manga Typesetter is [MIT](LICENSE.md) licensed. It builds on open-source
components that carry their own licenses and copyright notices, reproduced
below as those licenses require.

This file covers what the distributed application contains or fetches. It is
not a full transitive dependency list - the Rust side alone resolves to a few
hundred crates. `npm ls` and `cargo tree` produce those; what follows is the
set with terms worth stating.

`hyphenation.en-us` ships the en-US Liang hyphenation patterns and declares no
license of its own. Its source header points at the TeX hyphenation repository
(`tug.org/svn/texhyphen`), whose en-US patterns are distributed without
restriction. The package is used unmodified, for pattern data only.

## Bundled Rust

The desktop shell is [Tauri 2](https://tauri.app) (MIT / Apache-2.0). Its
dependency graph resolves to roughly 580 crates. Every one is permissive:
MIT, Apache-2.0, BSD, ISC, Zlib, Unicode-3.0, or a dual license including one
of those. There is no GPL, LGPL, or AGPL code in the build.

Five crates are MPL-2.0, reached through Tauri's CSS handling and its
directory lookups:

- `cssparser` 0.36.0
- `cssparser-macros` 0.6.1
- `selectors` 0.36.1
- `dtoa-short` 0.3.5
- `option-ext` 0.2.0

MPL-2.0 is per-file copyleft. These crates are used unmodified, so naming them
here and pointing to their source repositories satisfies the license:
<https://github.com/servo/rust-cssparser>, <https://github.com/servo/stylo>,
<https://github.com/upsuper/dtoa-short>, <https://github.com/soc/option-ext>.
Their source is available under MPL-2.0 from those repositories.

Also worth noting:

- [ONNX Runtime](https://onnxruntime.ai), MIT, © Microsoft Corporation.
  Prebuilt binaries are fetched at build time by
  [`ort`](https://ort.pyke.io) and shipped inside the application.
- [SQLite](https://sqlite.org), public domain. Compiled in through
  `rusqlite`'s bundled amalgamation, used read-only to parse `.sut` brush
  files.

## Machine-learning models

No model weights are distributed with the application. The app downloads them
on first use, direct from the publisher, into the user's cache. Each model
is governed by its publisher's terms, not by this project's license.

| Model | Source | Terms |
| --- | --- | --- |
| manga109 YOLO detector | [deepghs/manga109_yolo](https://huggingface.co/deepghs/manga109_yolo) | YOLO11 lineage; Ultralytics applies AGPL-3.0 to its models |
| comic text detector | [manga-image-translator](https://github.com/zyddnys/manga-image-translator) | published from a GPL-3.0 repository |
| manga-ocr-base | [kha-white/manga-ocr](https://github.com/kha-white/manga-ocr), [ONNX build](https://huggingface.co/onnx-community/manga-ocr-base-ONNX) | Apache-2.0 |

The application runs these as ONNX graphs through `ort`. It does not link,
vendor, or redistribute the Ultralytics package or any other AGPL or GPL code.

## Fonts

No fonts are bundled. The interface uses the operating system's font
stack, and lettering uses fonts already installed on the user's machine.

// ===== App preferences =====
// Preferences that belong to the person, not to a document: they survive a
// chapter close and are never written into a saved file - the typesetting beta,
// the defaults a new text box is born with, and the keyboard rebindings. The
// shape is one `$state` object, one localStorage key holding all of it, and a
// single setter, so a preference can never be changed without being persisted
// and applied in the same breath.
//
// The module APPLIES on import, not on some `initPrefs()` call, because what it
// gates is the layout engine and layout runs the moment a page mounts.
// App.svelte imports it at boot for exactly that reason: by the time anything
// measures a line, `setTypesetEnabled` has already been told.
//
// Both consumers are leaves or near-leaves and neither imports this module back,
// which is what keeps that import-time apply safe: nothing here can run before
// the module it is writing into has finished evaluating.

  // value a box is BORN with; once a box exists its own style is what answers,
  // and a bulk edit is how one is changed after the fact. The Inspector used to
  // carry a switch per box for each of them, which put five engine settings in
  // front of someone trying to move a bubble; they are one set of defaults, so
  // they are set once, here.

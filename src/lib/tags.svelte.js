// ===== Tags =====
// A tag is a name the user puts on a queued line - `sfx`, `narration`, whatever
// else they invent - plus an optional default font and outline that a box picks
// up at the moment it is placed.
//
// Two halves, deliberately kept apart, because they persist in different places
// and for different reasons:
//
//   the applied tags  live on the line, in chapter.json, with the document.
//                     They are what the user marked up, and they mean nothing
//                     without the chapter they were marked on.
//   the registry      lives in localStorage, beside the panel geometry and the
//                     export prefs. It is a working vocabulary - "sfx means
//                     Bangers with a fat outline" - and it belongs to the person,
//                     not to the chapter. The decisive argument is that nothing
//                     needs it to draw: a tag's defaults are baked into the box's
//                     own style at placement time, so a chapter opened on a
//                     machine with an empty registry renders identically to one
//                     opened here. A registry in chapter.json would be a second
//                     copy of that vocabulary per chapter, drifting apart the
//                     first time the user changed their mind.
//
// This module imports nothing. Not the store, not the filesystem - the functions
// that touch the document take the pages they work on as an argument, which is
// also what makes the whole model testable in node. The store imports *this*,
// for the one thing that has to happen inside placement.

// Every write here is a discrete click - created a tag, edited a tag, applied a
// tag - never a drag or a key repeat, so there is nothing to coalesce and the
// write is synchronous, exactly like `saveExportPrefs`. The debounced tier is for
// writers driven by a gesture; this is not one.
const KEY = 'mt.tags';

// The two values `line.type` has ever carried that mean anything to a reader.
// `dialogue` is the unmarked default and is deliberately not a tag: the queue has
// always hidden its badge, and promoting it would put a tag on every line in
// every chapter ever imported.
export const LEGACY_TAGS = ['sfx', 'narration'];

// A tag name is folded to one canonical spelling before anything else sees it.
// Without this, a user typing `SFX` creates a second tag beside the `sfx` that is
// already in every chapter.json detection has ever written, and the migration
// below buys nothing. Length is capped because the name is rendered in a badge on
// a row in a narrow floating panel.
// This function must be idempotent - `normalizeTagName(normalizeTagName(x))`
// has to equal `normalizeTagName(x)` - because the two halves of the model
// normalise at different moments and then compare the results by string
// equality. `tagsInUse` reports the name stored on the line; `boxesWithTag`
// re-normalises the name it is handed and matches against that. A name that
// changed on the second pass matched nothing, so a tag the panel had just
// offered restyled zero boxes and the queue's lit chip added a near-duplicate
// instead of removing it.
//
// Hence the second trim, after the cap and not before it: a 25-character name
// whose 24th character is a space came out of `.slice()` still carrying it.

// what a stored entry with a bad colour sanitises down to) opened with the
// switch off, and Save wrote the width away.
//
// The switch means "this tag sets an outline", so it lights for either half, and

// ---------- surviving a re-import ----------
// A translations file describes `{ n, jp, en, type }` and nothing else - the
// importer has never had a `tags` field to read, and re-importing replaces a
// page's lines wholesale. So re-running a corrected translation over a chapter
// that had been tagged by hand threw every hand-applied tag away while leaving
// the boxes exactly where they were: `sfx` and `narration` came back through
// `type`, and anything the user had invented was gone with no warning.
//
// This carries them across, joined by line number, which is the same join the
// placed boxes already use (`box.lineN`). The rule is the one `lineTags` already
// states: the presence of a `tags` array is the marker that the user has taken
// over that line, so where it is present it wins outright and the incoming
// `type` does not get a vote. A line the user never touched has no array and
// takes whatever the file says, exactly as before.
//
// Written through `setLineTags` so the restored tags also re-project onto
// `type`; otherwise a restored line would carry `tags: ['sfx']` under the
// incoming `type: 'dialogue'` and the exporters, which still read `type`, would
// disagree with the queue about the same line.
//
// Precedence, in full: an incoming line that carries its own `tags` array wins -
// the file said something explicit and a file the user chose to import is a
// statement. Failing that, the previous page's array carries forward. Failing
// both, the incoming `type` speaks, which is the pre-tag behaviour unchanged.
//
// It also keeps the page's free-typed lines - the ones a box made with the Text
// tool brought into existence, numbered below zero (see `isFreeLine` in
// store.svelte.js). A translations file describes the translator's lines and
// says nothing whatever about these, so the wholesale replacement would take
// them out, and the cost is not a tag: it is the *text*, which is where a free
// box's text lives, plus the box's only queue row. The user would be left with a
// box on the page rendering nothing, no row to type into, and no way back short
// of re-importing the old file. They are appended after the incoming lines, in
// their own order, which is where they already sit in the queue - free lines are
// pushed on the end as they are made, so a re-import does not shuffle the panel.
//
// A number the incoming file already claims is left to the file. It cannot
// happen from any producer this app has met (translators number from 1) and if
// it does, two lines answering to one number is the one outcome nothing
// downstream survives - `lineByN` would hand the box whichever came first.

// ---------- defaults reaching a box ----------
// Called once, by `placeActiveAt`, at the instant the box is created - the only

// that the box then owns outright, which is why editing the tag later cannot
// touch it.
//
// `base` is consumed: the flat keys are copied over it and the nested groups
// (shadow, roughen) come through by reference, so every caller hands over a style
// it has just cloned rather than one something else still holds.
//
// The leftmost tag wins. A later tag only fills in what the earlier ones left
// unset, so the first tag on a line is its primary one and adding a second cannot
// quietly restyle it. An unset default - the `null` - is what makes tags optional
// at all: it changes nothing, and the box keeps the style it would have had.

// ===== Liquify, applied to a box's mesh =====
//
// The liquify field (`liquify.js`) moves points. Here the points are the control
// points of the box's warp mesh - the same `style.warp` the Transform sub-tab
// drags by hand - so one tool bends the type and the ink together, through the
// texture path the exporter already has, and the result is stored as nothing
// but a mesh. A liquified box is a warped box; undo, reset and export all
// already know what to do with one.
//
// Two halves, the rule between them being this file's boundary, as in
// `warp-gizmo.js`: above it pure geometry a node test can hold; below it the
// one gesture that writes a document.
//
// Every coordinate is BOX-LOCAL page px.

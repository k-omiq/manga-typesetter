//
//   styleForLine     the style a placed box is born with, and - since applying
//                    a tag to an already-placed line restyles its box - the
//                    style that box is moved to. One function for both, so the
//                    two orders (tag then place, place then tag) cannot drift
//                    into two different answers.
//   boxesWithTag     the boxes a tag-scoped bulk edit lands on.
//   toggleLineTag    the write itself, wrapped by `toggleTagOnLine` below so the
//                    restyle and its history entry cannot be forgotten by a
//                    caller.
//   lineTags         to tell an apply from an un-apply, which is the only one of
//                    the two that restyles anything.
//   normalizeTagName so a hand-edited chapter.json cannot put a tag on a line in
//                    a spelling the rest of the app would treat as a second tag.
//   carryTagsForward the one rule for "this page's lines are being replaced

// did not appear in the "N / M placed" count of the page it was on. It now gets
// a line of its own, and the whole of what makes that line *free* is its number:
//
//   n < 0  - free-typed. The user made this line by typing on the canvas.
//   n > 0  - imported. The translator numbered it; psd.js and exporter.js write
//            that number out and a re-imported translations file joins on it.
//

// carried by every serializer the document passes through - chapter.json,
// `serializePage` in psd.js, the detected-text JSON export - and any one of them
// forgetting it turns a free line into an imported line with an absurd number.
// `n` is already carried by all of them, because nothing works without it.
//
// Negative because every producer of a translations file numbers from 1: the
// engine's detector, the JSON importer's own fallback (`Number(n) || idx + 1`
// in `normLine`), and this app's exporter. So the two spaces cannot meet, no
// imported line ever has to be renumbered to make room, and a re-import - which

//                           queue - which is the whole point of giving it a
//                           line. One copy of the text, in the one place the

// line renders a stale copy for as long as the user keeps typing, and typing

// The box's rectangle has to describe its text. It did not: the editor renders
// with `overflow:visible` and the exporter grows a footprint of its own
// (`topExtra`/`bottomExtra` in `layoutBox`), so four wrapped lines in a box sized
// for two spilled above and below the rectangle and out of the speech bubble,
// with nothing anywhere saying so. For a typesetting tool that is not a cosmetic
// problem - the rectangle is the thing the user positions, resizes and aligns,
// and a rectangle that lies about its contents makes every one of those gestures
// guesswork.
//
// So the height follows the text, and this is the one function that makes it do
// so. Every path that can change what the box has to fit calls it - inline
// typing, the Inspector's text field and style controls, the queue's own
// translation field, a bulk apply, a tag apply, a width drag, a placement, a
// chapter load, and a font arriving after all of those (`noteFontsChanged`) -
// because a `$effect` in the component would only ever cover the boxes rendered
// on the page currently on screen. The one path that does NOT call it is an undo
// or redo, which restores the recorded geometry directly rather than re-deriving
// it; see below.
//
// WIDTH IS NEVER TOUCHED. The width is what the user aimed at the bubble; it is
// the input to the line breaking, not an output of it.
//
// Records nothing of its own. The grow is not an edit - it is a consequence of
// an edit the user has already made, and giving it its own history entry would
// charge two presses of undo for one gesture. Instead every record whose edit
// can trigger a grow carries the box's `y`/`h` on both sides of it (`geomBefore`
// / `geomAfter` - see `fitGeom` below and the `style`, `text` and `bulk` kinds in
// history.svelte.js), so one press puts back the geometry the box actually had.
// It used to re-run this on the way back instead, which cannot work: the fit is
// grow-only by design, so an undo could never give back the height the grow took
// - and an undo that restored `autoHeight:false` could not even try.

// tail of `autoFitBox` with the breaking removed and nothing else changed, which
// is what makes the two agree by construction: there is one grow rule, one set
// of guards, and one place either of them can be edited.
//

// ---------- a font arriving changes every measurement ----------
// Text metrics are not a constant. A user font is registered asynchronously -
// read out of IndexedDB at boot, or added from a file mid-session - and until
// its face is in `document.fonts` every measurement of a box using it is made
// against the fallback family. That is the normal cold-start order, not an edge
// case: `loadProjectPages` refits the whole chapter against the fallback, writes
// each `box.h` from it, and the real face lands a moment later.
//
// Nothing then recomputed anything, and the disagreement was permanent and
// three-way: the canvas kept the breaks it had derived, `box.h` kept a height
// derived from a font nobody is looking at, and the exporter - which awaits
// `document.fonts.ready` before it measures - broke the lines somewhere else
// again and drew a block of a different height. The user's own screen was the
// one thing that was wrong.
//
// So a face becoming available is an event, and this is it. Two halves, and both
// are needed:
//
//   the counter  `app.fontsVersion`, read reactively by everything that derives
//                a layout from a measurement (`TextBox`'s shaped lines and its
//                fit effect). Bumping it is what makes a component recompute
//                breaks it has no other reason to doubt.
//   the refit    the boxes in the open chapter, including the pages not on
//                screen, which have no component to re-run anything.
//
// Idempotent and grow-only like every other fit, so calling it more often than
// strictly necessary costs a measurement pass and changes nothing else.
//
// `fonts.js` calls this after it registers a face, and `App.svelte` calls it
// once `document.fonts.ready` resolves at boot, which covers the built-in faces
// and any face the browser was still fetching.

  //         durable half: same number, same `jp` means the detector found the
  //         same sentence again and the English typed against it still belongs
  //         to it. A changed `jp` means that number now names a different

//   the line's own      the queue row being placed has detected geometry. This is

// Neither, and the old constants stand. A page that was never detected, or a
// free-typed box, keeps behaving exactly as it did.
//
// The rect is inset before it becomes a box, because a detected rect is drawn
// tight around ink and text pressed against a bubble's outline is the thing
// letterers spend their time avoiding. The inset scales with the rect, so a

// for: the user has a translation in the queue, the page was never analysed (or
// the detector missed this bubble), and all they do is point at the balloon they
// want the text in. That gesture carries exactly one piece of information - the
// point - and the page's own pixels can turn it into the same shape a detection
// would have produced, because the balloon is drawn on the page whether or not
// anything has looked for it.
//
// Every guard `balloonFitFor` applies applies here too, for the same reasons,

//
//   the shape must contain the click. The fill is seeded at the pointer so the
//   REGION contains it by construction, but the fitted shape is an approximation
//   of that region, and an ellipse fitted to a bubble the user clicked near the
//   rim of can end up excluding the very point they aimed at. Sizing a box from
//   such a fit moves it somewhere they did not point, which reads as the click
//   having been swallowed. Falling back puts the box under the pointer, which is
//   the one thing the gesture unambiguously asked for.
//

// and the balloon under the box now has nothing in it. Re-deciding the fit on
// every render is not an option - it is a flood fill over a megapixel - so it is

// where the user has put it, so seeding a fill from inside it finds the balloon
// the box is on now. A box sitting on bare paper, on a burst, or on a page whose
// pixels are not decoded gets its fit cleared rather than left pointing at a
// bubble it has been dragged away from - a stale fit is worse than none, because
// the text is laid out to a curve that is no longer under it.
//
// Not recorded in the undo history. The fit is derived geometry rather than an
// edit with a before and an after that the user typed, and every history entry
// kind carries a fixed set of fields (see history.svelte.js) that this is not
// one of. What an undo of the surrounding edit does restore is the fit a

// else, and the user was left to conclude the tag defaults did not work.
//
// So an apply now restyles the box, and the rule is exactly the rule placement
// already follows - the box is moved to `styleForLine(line, its own style)`.
// Stated the other way round: after applying a tag, the box carries the style it
// would have been born with had it been placed under the line's tags as they now
// stand. The two orders agree by construction, because they are the same
// function; there is no second answer to keep in step.
//
// What that means for manual styling, since it is the question the rule has to
// answer: the tag wins, over the three fields a tag can define and no others.
// `styleForLine` only ever sets font and the stroke list, and only those
// its tags actually define - so size, colour, shadow, warp, rotation, every
// property the user set by hand in the Inspector, come through untouched. If the
// tag defines nothing, nothing changes, nothing is recorded, and the caller is
// told so. The alternative - manual styling wins - makes an apply do nothing on
// precisely the boxes the user has been fiddling with, which is the complaint
// this exists to answer. It is one undo press away either way.
//
// Un-applying restyles nothing. A box's style is a value it owns, not a
// reference to the tag; there is no "what it would have been" to go back to, and
// guessing would be a second rule for the same button.
//
// The tag write itself is not history - it never has been, and the chip is its

// font this machine has not got - a chapter authored elsewhere, or a font the
// user has since removed from the library - and everything downstream then
// silently draws the fallback instead. Callers that have to describe what was
// drawn (the PSD exporter names a face and says whether it was synthesised)
// need the same answer the renderer got, so the substitution happens here, once,
// rather than being re-derived per caller.

// ===== The page's own pixels, decoded once =====
//
// `balloon.js` recovers a bubble's interior from the page's pixels, and it is
// deliberately agnostic about where those pixels come from: it takes an
// `ImageData`-shaped object and the caller decides. This module is that
// decision for the app.
//
// The requirement that shapes everything here is that placement asks
// SYNCHRONOUSLY. A click lands a box, and the box's size comes out of the fit -
// so the fit has to be available in the same turn as the click, or placement
// would have to become async and every caller of `placeActiveAt` (the canvas,
// the tests, the history) would have to learn about promises for the sake of one
// optional refinement. Decoding a 2000x3000 page costs tens of milliseconds and
// allocates 24 MB; doing that inside a click handler is not acceptable, and
// doing it once per page and remembering the answer is.
//
// Which raster. The canvas draws `p.cleaned ?? p.raw` and so does every
// exporter, so that is what gets decoded here - the detector must run on the
// picture the user is looking at. It matters when the two differ, which is
// exactly the case a clean creates: the raw still has the Japanese in it, and
// the flood fill seeded inside a text block would meet glyphs the cleaned page
// no longer has. Fitting the cleaned raster is both the better answer (a wiped
// balloon is a clean interior with nothing in it to trip over) and the
// consistent one (the shape is stored in page coordinates and drawn over the
// same art).
//
// The bound is the other half. A 200-page chapter decoded page by page would
// hold five gigabytes of `ImageData` alive, which is not a cache, it is a leak
// with a lookup table in front of it. So the map evicts the least recently used,
// and a hit promotes. A miss is not an error: the caller falls back to the
// detector's rectangle, which is what it did before this module existed.
//
// What the bound cannot be is two entries. That was the first number here, and
// it was chosen for a pager - one page on screen, one being turned to - which is
// exactly the reading mode a longstrip chapter does not have. A webtoon column
// mounts a resident window of up to twelve slices around the scroll position
// (`residentRadiusFor` in editor/strip.js) and every one of them decodes and
// calls in here, so a two-entry map is emptied and refilled by pages the user is
// nowhere near. Promotion does not save it: the evictions are driven by DECODES,
// not by reads, and ten of them land between one click and the next. The page
// under the cursor - the only one anybody is going to click - was routinely the
// one thrown away.
//
// So the bound is stated the way the cost actually is: in bytes, with a count
// beside it. An `ImageData` is 4 bytes a pixel and pages differ by an order of
// magnitude in area - a webtoon slice is a fraction of a print page - so a count
// alone is either too loose for big pages or pointlessly tight for small ones.
// The byte budget is what keeps the memory honest; the count keeps the map from
// growing long on thumbnails. Whichever binds first, binds.
const MAX_PAGES = 8;
// 256 MB - about ten print-scale pages, or a resident window of webtoon slices,
// and a small fraction of what the renderer holds in decoded `<img>`s anyway.

// insertion order, which is what makes "delete the oldest key" one line and
// "promote on hit" two.
const cache = new Map();

// Drop least-recently-used entries until both bounds hold. Never the last one:

// ===== the decode that has not happened yet =====

// `rememberPagePixels` is called from the canvas's `onload`, which is the middle
// of a page turn - and a 1500x2400 `getImageData` there is ~20ms of the turn
// spent on something nobody has asked for yet. Most page turns never place a
// box, so most of those decodes are pure cost.
//
// So the canvas defers it to an idle callback and leaves the raw ingredients
// here on the way past. Two things then hold:
//
//   the turn is cheap - the idle callback does the decode when the browser has
//   a moment, and by the time anyone clicks, the map is warm;
//   a click that beats the idle callback still gets its fit - `pagePixelsFor`
//   falls through to this and decodes SYNCHRONOUSLY, which is exactly what the
//   old code did on every turn and is now the rare path rather than the rule.
//
// Bounded like everything else here, and the bound is the FIFO below - but a
// note is meant to be short-lived, not merely capped. What it holds is the
// page's `<img>` element, and that costs nothing beyond the reference only for
// as long as the canvas still has the element mounted: once the resident window
// has moved past the page, the element is detached and the note is the only
// thing keeping its decoded bitmap - fourteen megabytes of a print page -
// alive. So a note is dropped the moment it is answered
// (`rememberPagePixels`) and the moment the page's pictures are given back
// (`forgetPagePixels`, called from `releasePageImages`), and the cap is the
// backstop rather than the policy.
//
// The `src` recorded with it is checked before use, so a note left for a raster
// that has since been replaced misses rather than answering with the wrong art.

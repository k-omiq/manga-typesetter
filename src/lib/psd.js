// bold FACE - PostScript names are per-face, "MangaTemple-Bold" and not
// "MangaTemple" - with the faux flag off. Only a face nobody has a file for
// keeps the flag on, because there the renderer here is synthesising it too and
// the flag is the honest description of what the pixels already show.
//

// "Arial-BoldMT", "CCWildWords-Regular", "AnimeAce2BB-Italic"). For a known

// only when no parsed name exists (such as built-in CSS fallbacks or fonts never
// registered from a file).
//
// Both halves are asked about the SAME family - `fontNameFor` - and not about

// layer describing a font nobody rendered.
//

// True when a box's style is something Photoshop's own text engine cannot

// `text` object.
//
// The reason this predicate has to exist at all: Photoshop ALWAYS re-renders a
// live type layer from its own engine data and throws the cached `imageData`
// away. So "we baked it into the pixels" is not a fallback for a live type
// layer - it is only a fallback for readers that are not Photoshop. Anything
// the type layer cannot state is either painted wrong (a different shape over
// our pixels) or silently dropped (our effect gone), and both are the export
// lying about what the app shows. Dropping `text` makes Photoshop treat the
// layer as a plain image and show exactly the bytes we hand it.
//
// Geometry - Photoshop would lay the glyphs out somewhere else:
//   curve   - our per-character circular-arc layout (arcLayout in measure.js)
//             is not the same shape as Photoshop's `arc` warp. Attaching the
//             warp anyway made Photoshop re-render the glyphs along ITS arc,
//             on open, over the cached pixels that were laid out along ours.
//   path    - text on the user's bezier (pathLayout), placed by arc length
//             with a per-glyph tangent. A type layer has no path to follow, so
//             Photoshop re-renders it as a straight paragraph in the box rect.
//   circle  - the closed ring (circleLayout). Same failure as `path`.
//   flip    - the mirror is baked into the pixels (paintBoxOnPage's ctx.scale
//             in exporter.js), but a type layer's transform below is
//             [cos, sin, -sin, cos, tx, ty], which has determinant +1 and so
//             cannot express a reflection at all. Left as a type layer, a
//             mirrored box re-rendered the right way round over the mirrored
//             pixels - the same failure as the curve, for the same reason.
//
// Ink - Photoshop would lay the glyphs out right and then paint them wrong:
//   roughen  - a seeded pixel-displacement filter (roughen() in exporter.js)
//              with nothing in Photoshop's type engine that produces it at
//              all; there is no warp/style value that could stand in for it.
//   clip     - the visibility mask hides part of the box's ink. A re-render
//              has no mask, so Photoshop shows the letters the user erased.
//              Only counted when the mask actually has shapes - `clipActive`
//              is the one statement of that, shared with both renderers.
//   blur     - a gaussian over the finished composite (fill + strokes +
//              shadows together). Photoshop's type effects blur each effect on
//              its own track; there is no whole-layer blur to ask for.
//   motion   - the directional smear, likewise, and only when it has a
//              direction to smear along (0,0 draws nothing - see
//              motionBlurExtent).
//   pattern  - a tiled fill. Photoshop's patternOverlay takes a pattern from
//              the document's pattern table, not a tile we can hand it here,
//              and a type layer's own fill is one flat colour.
//   gradient - only the shapes `gradientOverlayable` accepts survive; the rest
//              would come out as a flat `fillColor`.
//
// A raster-only box still round-trips losslessly through this app - the
// embedded project JSON (see buildPagePsd) is what re-import actually reads -
// so this predicate only ever affects what a foreign copy of Photoshop shows.
// The cost of saying yes here is editability in Photoshop, and it is only paid
// by a box that switched one of these on; the ordinary box (strokes, shadows,
// a block gradient) is untouched and stays live type.

  // and completely ignores the cached pixels in `imageData`. Without layer
  // effects, opening the PSD in Photoshop with the font installed shows bare
  // text lacking both outline and shadow.
  //
  // Stroke position: the canvas draws each stroke centred on the glyph outline
  // at twice the sum of every visible width up to and including it, and lets the
  // strokes inside it (and the fill) cover the half that fell within the glyph -
  // see text-paint.js. So the SIZE Photoshop needs for an 'outside' stroke is
  // that cumulative sum, which is what `strokeBands` already carries: the outer
  // edge of band i. Photoshop paints its effects list in order, so the list goes
  // in outermost first, exactly as the canvas paints it.
  //
  // Drop shadow: canvas uses Cartesian pixel offsets (x, y) where positive y is
  // downward. Photoshop represents a shadow by a light source angle in degrees
  // (measured counter-clockwise from the +x axis) and a distance in pixels, with
  // the shadow cast AWAY from the light source. A light source at angle θ in
  // Photoshop casts a shadow at vector (-distance * cos(θ), distance * sin(θ)).
  // Converting canvas (x, y) gives distance = hypot(x, y) and angle = atan2(y, -x).
  //
  // Everything Photoshop's type engine cannot state - the pattern fill, the
  // whole-text blur, the smear, the mask, a per-line or radial gradient - is
  // not here: `isRasterOnly` sent that box down the raster branch above, so by

// file with a white composite gave a white thumbnail, and on the identical file
// without one gave solid black.
//

// extra full-page raster of pixels the layers already carry - measured at
// +2,643,180 bytes on an 800x1150 page, the same delta under RLE and under ZIP
// - and the user's decision was that the merged composite stays out. A
// constant-value raster, by contrast, is free: ag-psd emits the composite
// section whether or not it is handed one, and a run-length code spends the
// same bytes on a run of 255s as on the run of 0s it would otherwise write.
// Measured on that same page: 5,490,174 bytes with a white composite, with an
// all-black one, and with none at all - byte-identical, all three.

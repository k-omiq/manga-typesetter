  // held open by an export is exempt. `openChapter` sets the first window
  // itself, so the chapter is drawable before this ever runs; this is the page
  // turns, and a chapter swapped underneath the editor without a remount.
  // The two dependencies are named and read here; the call itself is untracked.
  // `setResidentWindow` both reads and writes `raw`/`cleaned` on page objects,
  // and tracked it would re-run itself every time a prefetch landed - harmless,
  // because a second pass over an already-minted window does nothing, but it is
  // a loop that only terminates by luck and there is no reason to keep it.
  //
  // A strip needs a different rule, and it is the same rule measured in the unit
  // that matters. Five pages is five screens of lookahead when the slices are
  // 1000px tall and a third of one screen when they are 8000px, and in a strip
  // the reader is not turning pages - they are scrolling, continuously, past
  // whatever is in the window. So the radius is grown until the window holds
  // three viewports of art either side, with the paged radius as its floor and a
  // hard cap on top: see `residentRadiusFor`. The heights are the on-screen ones
  // (page pixels × zoom), because it is screens of scrolling being counted.
  //
  // `window.innerHeight` rather than the canvas viewport's own height: the
  // canvas layer is `inset:0` of a viewport-fixed root, so the two agree to
  // within the chrome that floats over it, and reading it here needs no seam
  // through Canvas for a number that is only ever multiplied by three.

    // radius computed from those heights is the cap - twelve pages held in
    // memory - and left untracked it stayed the cap for the rest of the session,
    // because the decodes that fill `p.h` in never re-ran this.
    //
    // Tracking them is safe in the one way that matters: nothing below writes a
    // page's height. `setResidentWindow` writes `raw`/`cleaned`, which is what
    // the untrack is still here for - tracked, a landing prefetch would re-enter
    // this effect - and `p.h` is written only by the canvas measuring a decoded
    // image. So this re-runs when a page is measured and never on its own
    // output. A paged chapter takes no dependency on the heights at all.

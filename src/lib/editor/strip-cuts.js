// ===== Where a longstrip chapter is cut into files =====
//
// The pages a webtoon arrives as are not the pages it ships as. The source
// slices are whatever the raw came cut into; the delivered slices are whatever
// the target site wants (a few thousand pixels of height each), and the two have
// nothing to do with one another. So the exporter re-cuts the column - and the
// only thing it must never do is cut through lettering. A seam through art is
// invisible; a seam through a speech balloon's text is the one defect a reader
// cannot un-see, and it cannot be fixed downstream.
//
// This file is that decision and nothing else: no canvas, no store, no images.
// It takes the geometry of the chapter and returns the y positions to cut at, in
// strip pixels, which is the space `stripOffsets(pages)` answers in at zoom 1 -
// the same space the stitched export canvas works in.

import { stripOffsets } from './strip.js';

// How much clear space a cut must leave above and below any lettering. A cut
// that grazes a box's edge is as bad as one through it: the glyph outlines,
// shadows and roughening all overflow the box rect (see `layoutBox` in
// exporter.js), and this module cannot measure text - it has no fonts and no
// DOM. The pad is the allowance for that overflow as much as it is breathing
// room, which is why it is generous rather than tight.

// A slice may run short of the target - the cut moved up to clear a box - but
// not to nothing, and it may run long, but not so long the site rejects it.

// whatever the user asked for.

// target is a chapter of confetti or one file no reader can load.

// around the box CENTRE, so the axis-aligned bound of the rotated rect is the
// projection of both of its axes onto the vertical: |sin|·w + |cos|·h. A box
// turned 90° is as tall as it is wide, and a cut planned off `box.h` would run
// straight through it.

// Flips are ignored on purpose: mirroring a rect around its own centre leaves
// its bounds exactly where they were.

// Plan the whole chapter's cuts.

// Returns `{ cuts, warnings }` where `cuts` is the boundaries of the output
// files - `[0, y1, y2, …, total]`, so slice n is `cuts[n]..cuts[n+1]` and there
// is one fewer file than there are numbers. A chapter with no height at all
// returns no cuts rather than a zero-height slice.
//
// The walk: from the previous cut, the ideal next one is `targetHeight` below
// it. If that lands in clear space it is taken as-is. If it lands in a band the
// cut MOVES, and which way it moves is the whole policy:
//
//   · UP to the band's top, by preference. Up shortens the current slice and
//     lengthens the next, which is the harmless direction - the reader sees the
//     same column either way and no file grows.
//   · DOWN past the band's bottom when up would leave a runt: a cut less than
//     MIN_SLICE_RATIO of the target below the previous one is a sliver of a
//     file, and a site that pages by image would show it as a flash.
//   · Neither, when the bands are dense enough that up is a runt and down is
//     past MAX_SLICE_RATIO of the target. Then the cut goes to whichever band
//     edge is nearer the ideal - the least-bad file size, still not through
//     lettering.
//   · Through the lettering, only when the band is taller than the widest slice
//     allowed AND its top is already at or above the previous cut - i.e. the
//     previous cut is itself that band's top and there is nowhere left to
//     retreat to. One 3000px box against a 1000px target does that, and so does
//     a run of boxes packed close enough to fuse into 3000px of band: either way
//     there is no clear pixel to cut at, so the ideal position is taken and the
//     caller is told, by name, that this one file has a seam through its text.

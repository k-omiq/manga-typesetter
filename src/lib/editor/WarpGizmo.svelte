  // ===== The free-transform gizmo =====
  //
  // The handles of the mesh warp, over the selected box: a dot at every control
  // point, the hairline mesh between them, and the box's original outline as a
  // dashed ghost so the deformation can be read against where it started.
  //
  // It is a child of the box element, like the path gizmo and the mask overlay,
  // and for the same three reasons: the box's `left`/`top` places it, the box's
  // `transform: rotate()` rotates it (so a handle on a tilted box sits on the
  // corner it belongs to, with no rotation maths here at all), and being outside
  // the clip wrapper means the mask cannot hide the controls.
  //
  // What a drag costs is the one thing this file does differently from the
  // others. A warped box is not DOM text - it is a picture the exporter paints -
  // and repainting that picture per pointermove means re-rendering the type, the
  // ink, the blur, the smear and the mask forty times a second for a gesture
  // that changes none of them. So the texture is rendered ONCE, when the gesture
  // starts, and every frame after that re-runs only the mesh over it. That is
  // the `painter` prop: `begin` caches, `frame` warps the cache, `end` releases
  // it and hands the box back to its own reactive repaint.
  //
  // ONE SESSION AT A TIME, and every ending goes through `endSession`. A gesture
  // can end without a pointer event: the gizmo is unmounted mid-drag whenever
  // the user arms the brush, switches sub-tab or selects another box, and a
  // teardown that only removed the listeners would leave the mesh wherever the
  // pointer had dragged it, with nothing on the undo stack to take it back, the
  // cached texture unreleased, and `warpDragging` stuck true - which freezes the
  // box's own repaints for the rest of the session.

  /* Same shape as the path gizmo: the svg lets clicks through to the box and
     only the handles take the pointer. z-index 4 puts it over the brush's
     capture surface (3), so an armed brush cannot swallow a handle.

     THE PALETTE, and why it is not the theme's. Every colour here is drawn over
     the PAGE, and the page is `--paper` in both themes - light in dark mode too,
     because a manga page is ink on paper and inverting it would misrepresent the
     art (the same rule the brush panel's tip cells follow). So a token that
     flips with the theme - `--accent` is near-black on light and near-white on
     dark - would put a white hairline on white paper the moment the user
     switched. The gizmo therefore keeps the fixed page-facing palette the path
     and mask gizmos already use, declared here as custom properties so a theme
     that wants to override them can, with the current values as the fallback.
     The Reset chip is the exception and takes the real tokens: it is CHROME, a
     button floating above the box, and it reads as panel furniture in both
     themes. */

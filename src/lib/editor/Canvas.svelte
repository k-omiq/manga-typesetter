  // ---------- the pages a paged chapter keeps in the DOM ----------
  //
  // A page turn used to be a teardown and a mount: the frame, the image and
  // every TextBox on the page destroyed, and the same number created again for
  // the page arrived at - each box re-deriving its paint stack and re-breaking
  // its lines from nothing. That is Svelte doing exactly what it was told, and
  // it is most of what a turn cost once the layout memo and the collapsed
  // double-fit had taken the rest.
  //
  // So the neighbours stay mounted and hidden instead, and the turn is a
  // `display:none` moving from one frame to the next. Two properties make that
  // pay rather than merely move the cost around:
  //
  //   `display:none`, not `visibility:hidden` or `content-visibility`. A hidden
  //   frame has to contribute NOTHING to layout - the fit is measured against
  //   `.editor-scroll`'s content box, and a second page in the stage's flex row
  //   would widen the scroll, raise a scrollbar and shrink the very number the
  //   fit is computed from. It also means no paint: no SVG roughening filter, no
  //   gradient tile, no page raster composited for a page nobody is looking at.
  //   Images inside it still LOAD, which is the half we want - see `onCleanedLoad`.
  //
  //   The window slides on an idle callback, not in the turn. A sliding window
  //   mounts one page and destroys one page per turn, so done synchronously this
  //   would have paid the same mount cost it set out to remove - only on a
  //   different page. Deferred, the turn itself touches nothing but the two
  //   frames whose visibility changed, and the page arrived at was mounted one
  //   turn ago.
  //
  // Radius 1, not the image window's 2. The pictures are held either side of it
  // because a decode cannot be started at the moment it is needed; a mounted
  // frame is only there to be revealed, and one page either side already covers
  // both directions of a turn. Every extra page is fifteen more live components
  // whose autofit effects re-run on every style change the user makes, so the
  // window is the smallest one that answers the question. It may never exceed
  // the image window: a mounted page whose picture has been revoked draws blank.

  // The current page is in the list whether or not the reconcile below has

  // ---------- the boxes a strip keeps in the DOM ----------
  //
  // A strip mounts a frame per page of the chapter on purpose - they are empty
  // divs of a known size, the column's scroll height has to be right before any
  // art arrives, and the note at the `{#each}` below says so. What that note
  // overlooked is that the frames are not what a page costs: the BOXES inside
  // them are. A 200-slice webtoon at fifteen boxes a slice mounted three
  // thousand `TextBox` components, each with its own line-breaking `$derived`,
  // its own autofit `$effect` and its own paint stack - and every one of them
  // re-derives `boxStyle`, `textStyle` and `layers` on each `app.zoom` tick, so
  // one trackpad pinch (sixty to a hundred events) was three thousand boxes of
  // string building per event. That is the shape of a webview that stops
  // answering.
  //
  // So the boxes follow the pictures. The window is the SAME one
  // `page-images.js` is holding - `residentRadiusFor` off the on-screen heights,
  // exactly as EditorRoot computes it for the images - which is what makes this
  // invisible rather than merely cheaper: a slice outside it has had its raster
  // revoked and is already drawing as a blank frame, so there was never any art
  // under the text that has stopped being mounted. Inside it, everything is as
  // it was.

  //   · the margin was 100 against a stage that pads 60 on each side, so it
  //     handed back a zoom 20px of page too wide to fit;
  //   · getBoundingClientRect() counts the scrollbar gutter, and this app styles
  //     ::-webkit-scrollbar, which in WebKit means classic scrollbars that take
  //     real layout space. Fitting to a width that includes the bar overflows,
  //     which raises the bar, which is how a fit ends up with scrollbars on it;
  //   · the margin was a constant in this file, mirroring --stage-pad, and it
  //     was a lie on the vertical axis the moment the two differed. That is the
  //     one that mattered most, because the stage's vertical padding is no
  //     longer plain --stage-pad: `.editor-scroll` spans the FULL window height
  //     - the chrome pills at the top and the zoom dock at the bottom float over
  //     it and inset nothing - so `.stage` raises its top and bottom padding to
  //     clear them. Fit has to reserve the same band the stylesheet reserves, or
  //     it reports a page as fitting into space that is behind the dock.

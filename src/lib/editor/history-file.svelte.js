// An undo entry quotes STYLES, and a style's schema has moved: the flat
// `outline`/`outlineWidth`/`shadow{on,...}` era became `strokes[]`/`shadows[]`,
// and `gradient`/`pattern`/`fillOpacity`/`blur` joined it. `normalizeStyle` is
// where every other route into the document migrates - `loadProjectPages` for
// chapter.json, `parsePresets` for the stored presets - and this file is the
// last route that did not.
//
// Two of the three kinds that carry a style were already covered by accident:
// `style` and `bulk` go through `cloneStyle` (which IS `normalizeStyle`) on the
// way onto the box. `place` and `delete` do not - they `structuredClone(e.box)`
// straight back into the page - so an entry recorded by a build before strokes
// existed put a box on the page with no `strokes`, no `gradient` and no
// `pattern` at all. `TextBox.svelte` reads `s.pattern.on` and `s.gradient.on`
// unguarded, because every style that reaches it has been normalised; that box
// threw on render, taking the canvas with it. Undo of an old deletion was a
// crash, not a degradation.
//
// Done here, at the one place the document is parsed, rather than at the apply:
// the rescale below reads the same styles (`rescaleStyle` scales `strokes[].width`
// and knows nothing of `outlineWidth`), so a stack migrated only on its way to a
// box would still be rescaled in the old shape and lose its outline's width.
//
// Identity-preserving on purpose. An entry that is already current is handed
// back as the very object that came in, so a document that needed nothing is
// `===` the one parsed - which is what `rescaleStoredHistory` tests to decide
// whether the file is worth rewriting, and what keeps `sameStack`'s per-entry
// identity check meaning "somebody edited this page" rather than "this page was

// which throws a box back to where it sat under the previous raster - and the
// larger the resolution change, the further off-page it lands.
//
// Rescaled rather than discarded, because discarding is the answer that costs
// the user something real (the last five edits on every page of the chapter) for

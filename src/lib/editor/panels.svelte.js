// ===== Floating panel geometry =====
// The two right-hand editor panels are windows, not columns: the user drags,
// resizes and hides them, and the layout they leave behind is theirs across
// relaunches. This module owns nothing but that geometry - no DOM, no pointer
// handling - so the rules that are easy to get wrong (a window that shrank
// between sessions, a corrupt preference) are testable without a browser.
//
// The one thing it takes from the store is the interval its writes are debounced
// on, so this module and the sidebar's preference coalesce on the same beat
// rather than on two numbers that drifted apart. Nothing else - no state, no
// document.

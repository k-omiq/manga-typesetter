// ===== What the transform gizmo draws, and what a drag does to the mesh =====
//
// The gizmo itself is `editor/WarpGizmo.svelte`: an SVG over the selected box.
// Everything it draws and everything a gesture changes is worked out here
// instead, for the reason `warp.js` exists at all - the geometry is testable in
// node and the component is then only pointers and markup.
//
// Two halves, and the rule between them is the file's own boundary:
//
//   - Above the rule: pure. Positions, segments, index maths, the new mesh a
//     drag or a grid change produces. Nothing here reads or writes a document.
//   - Below it: the three gestures the gizmo commits - a handle drag, its
//     cancel, and Reset - which DO write the box and record history, one step
//     per gesture, exactly as the mask tool's shapes do. They live here rather
//     than in the component so that "one history entry per drag" is a claim a
//     node test can make.
//
// Every coordinate above the rule is box-local page px, the same space
// `warp.pts`, `clip.shapes` and `ink` are stored in. The zoom and the box's
// rotation are the component's business: it is a child of the box element, so
// the rotation is already applied to it, and the zoom is one multiply at the
// point of drawing.

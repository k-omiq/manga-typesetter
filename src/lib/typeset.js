// ===== Scanlation line breaking =====
//
// Plain CSS wrapping is greedy: it fills each line to the brim and drops
// whatever is left onto the last one. That is the right answer for a paragraph
// of prose in a column and the wrong one for a speech bubble, where the block of
// text is a shape the reader sees before they read a word of it. Letterers have
// rules about that shape, and they are the rules this module implements:
//
//   · the block reads as a square [] or a beehive/oval () - line widths roughly
//     equal, or narrow→wide→narrow. An hourglass )( - wide→narrow→wide - is the
//     one profile that is always wrong, because the pinched middle reads as a
//     gap in the text.
//   · a word of fewer than three letters never sits alone on a line.
//   · a long word that does not fit is carried whole to the next line, and is
//     split with a hyphen only when nothing else will do. See the hyphenation
//     section below for exactly when that is.
//
// Nothing here measures anything itself. `measureFn(str) -> number` is injected,
// which is what keeps the module pure, testable under node with a stand-in
// metric, and - more importantly - keeps `measure.js` the single owner of real
// text metrics. Two modules that both knew how to measure a string would be two
// modules that could disagree about where a line breaks, and the editor and the
// exporter would then draw different pictures of the same box.
//
// The user's text is never mutated. Every line handed back is a *slice* of the
// input, so interior spacing survives exactly as typed and `box.text` is
// untouched - the breaks are display and layout only. The single character this
// module is ever allowed to add is the hyphen at the end of a split line, and it
// exists only in the string that gets drawn.
//
// ===== the width is a shape, not a number =====
//
// The second argument used to be one scalar, which meant every line got the same
// allowance. That is right for a rectangular narration box and wrong for the
// oval balloons most dialogue sits in: inside an ellipse the usable width is
// narrow at the top and the bottom and widest across the middle, so a block that
// satisfies a scalar width still runs into the curve on its first and last
// lines. It may now instead be a callback, `widthsFor(lineCount) -> number[]`,
// which hands back the usable width of each line of a block of that many lines.
// A scalar still means "the same width for every line", so every existing caller
// is unchanged.
//
// The reason this is more than a parameter swap is that the widths depend on the
// line count, so each candidate line count in the search below has its own array
// of them, and every term in the cost function that used to divide by one W now
// divides by that line's own allowance. That single change is what keeps the
// shape rules meaning what they say: a line's *fill ratio* - how full it is
// relative to the room it was given - is the quantity all three shape terms were
// always really about. An ellipse's first line is physically narrow, but filled
// to the brim of its own narrow allowance its ratio is 1.0 like everyone else's,
// so raggedness sees no deviation, the pinch term sees no shortfall, and the
// hourglass term sees no dip. The naturally-narrow ends of an oval are not a
// defect and are not scored as one. What the hourglass term now catches is the
// genuine article: a middle line that is *emptier than its own room* while the
// ends are full, which is exactly the gap a reader notices, and it catches it
// even when that middle line is physically the widest one on the page.
//
// ===== hyphenation =====
//
// Real scanlation splits a word rather than let a name hang out of a tall narrow
// balloon, and this module used to refuse to, so the word simply overflowed. It
// will now split one, under a rule deliberately narrow enough that ordinary text
// never meets it:
//
//   · a word is offered break points at all only if it does not fit on the
//     WIDEST line any candidate breaking could give it. That is the literal
//     reading of "it genuinely does not fit": if there is a line in this balloon
//     the word fits on, the search can put it there, and no hyphen is needed.
//     A word that fits somewhere is never carved up to tidy the block.
//   · having been offered them, a hyphen still has to win on price. `hyphen` is
//     large next to the raggedness scale, so the split has to be paid for by a
//     real defect elsewhere - and the defect it is there to pay for is
//     `overflow`, the new cost of a line hanging over the edge of its balloon.
//     Because that cost is quadratic, a word a hair too wide keeps its overflow
//     and a word half again too wide gets the hyphen.
//   · at least `minHyphenHead` letters before the hyphen and `minHyphenTail`
//     after it, counted in letters rather than characters, so a trailing "!"
//     cannot pass a stub off as a syllable. The tail rule is also the anti-stub
//     rule for the end of a paragraph: the last word's tail IS the last line.
//   · a word that already contains a hyphen breaks at that hyphen by preference
//     (`existingHyphen` is a fraction of `hyphen`), and when it does, nothing is
//     inserted - the line already ends in one, and a second would be an error.
//   · two hyphenated lines in a row cost `hyphenPair` on top of everything else,
//     so it happens only where there is no alternative. That rule is decomposable
//     and lives inside the dynamic program, because "the previous line ended in a
//     hyphen" is the same statement as "this line starts in the middle of a
//     word", which is a property of the break point this line starts at.
//
// The syllable points come from Liang's algorithm over the real TeX en-US
// pattern set (`hypher` + `hyphenation.en-us`). Its own leftmin/rightmin are 2
// and 3, the usual scanlation minimums, and this module re-checks both in
// letters afterwards rather than trusting them. Patterns are only consulted for
// a run of plain A-Z; anything else - a word with an apostrophe in the middle,
// an accented spelling, Cyrillic, kana, an SFX like "KRRSHH!!" - is left whole,
// because a wrong hyphenation is worse than none and en-US patterns have nothing
// true to say about any of those.

import Hypher from 'hypher';
import enUsPatterns from 'hyphenation.en-us';

// The knobs, and what each one is actually trading off.
//
// `ragged` and `lineCost` are the pair that decides how many lines the block
// gets: raggedness is measured against the candidate's own target fill ratio, so
// it is near zero for any line count that can be balanced, and `lineCost` is
// what then picks the fewest of those. Raising `lineCost` makes the algorithm
// accept a ragged two-line block rather than a tidy three-line one; lowering it
// does the reverse. Those two, and nothing else, choose the line count - see
// `pick`.
//
// The hourglass rule is enforced twice, and the split is the interesting part.
//
// `pinch` is the cheap half: a per-line cost on an INTERIOR line that falls
// short of the target. It is decomposable, so it lives inside the dynamic
// program and steers the break points while the DP still returns the true
// optimum for the line count. A short line has to go somewhere, and this is what
// puts it at the end rather than in the middle.
//
// `hourglass` is the half that judges the finished profile, which no per-line
// cost can see. It cannot go inside the DP, so it is applied where a profile
// exists: between two *complete* breakings of the SAME line count, one from the
// ordinary search and one from a search that leans on interior shortfalls hard
// enough to break the pinch (`pinchHard`). Both are then priced under the
// ordinary weights, so the comparison is honest and the heavier search is only
// ever a generator of candidates, never a scorer.
//
// That is a change of role, and it is why the weight can be this large. The term
// used to be added to each line count's total, where it competed with `lineCost`
// - so cranking it up stopped rejecting pinches and started rejecting line
// counts, and the block grew two extra lines to dodge a dip nobody would have
// noticed. At the weight that could not do that (6) it also could not do
// anything else. Measured over a 3000-string corpus: zeroing it changed 20
// outputs, and 151 blocks shipped with a pinched profile. Confined to a fixed
// line count it cannot buy a line at ANY weight - the two breakings it chooses
// between have the same number of them - so the deadband is what keeps it off
// ordinary text and the weight is free to be big enough to matter. At 300 the
// same corpus ships 133 pinched blocks against 167 with the term switched off,
// and 133 is very nearly the floor: an exhaustive search of every breaking at
// each block's own line count says 130 of them have no unpinched breaking at
// all. The mean line count is identical either way (3.198), and the mean spread
// between a block's widest and narrowest line moves from 0.235 to 0.238 - the
// repairs are not being bought with raggedness.
//
// `orphanCost` is the other constraint-as-cost. See the two passes at the bottom
// of `balanceParagraph` for why the rule has to be relaxable at all.

  // Overflow. A line wider than its own allowance hangs over the edge of the
  // balloon, which before this pass was something the module could notice and do
  // nothing about - an over-long word had to go somewhere and every breaking put
  // it in the same place, so pricing it would have been pricing a constant. It
  // is only now, with a hyphen on the table, that there are two different
  // answers to compare, and the term exists to make the comparison. Quadratic in
  // the fraction of the allowance exceeded, so a hair over is nearly free and
  // a lot over is not.
  //
  // Under a constant width this term is a constant: a line may only exceed its
  // width if it is a single unbreakable token (see `fits`), every breaking must
  // therefore give each over-long word a line of its own, and every breaking
  // consequently pays exactly the same total. A constant cannot move an argmin.
  // Under per-line widths it stops being constant, which is the point: it is
  // what steers an over-long word onto the widest line of an oval.
  //
  // "A constant cannot move an argmin" is true in arithmetic and one bit short
  // of true in float64, and the corpus says exactly how short. Over 54,000
  // breakings (3000 strings x 9 widths x 2 metrics), turning this term on with
  // hyphenation off changes 30 of them - 0.056% - and every one of the 30 is a
  // pair of breakings that cost the SAME. Twenty-nine have the identical
  // multiset of line widths; the thirtieth, `ANTIDISESTABLISHMENTARIANISM ...`
  // at width 22, is 0.45836776859504130 against 0.45836776859504136, a gap of
  // one unit in the last place. Carrying a constant of ~4 through four
  // additions costs about three ULPs of the running total, which is more than
  // that gap, so the tie lands on the other side. Which of two identically
  // priced breakings won was never a decision this module made - it was the
  // order the same numbers happened to be added in - and it is not one worth
  // buying back with a tolerance on the DP's comparison: a relative epsilon of
  // 1e-9 there does pin the ties down, and moves 96 other outputs while doing
  // it, which is a worse trade than the 30.

// not want, arrived at from the opposite direction to the vertical-Japanese

//
// The width has to be chosen at the same time as the height, and from the same
// measurement, or the two cannot describe a shape. What decides it:
//
//   the text's own area. A block of text is an area before it is a rectangle -
//   set it on one line and it is `totalAdvance` long and `lineHeight` tall, and
//   breaking it into `n` lines conserves that area (roughly: breaking wastes a
//   little at the end of each line, which is what `slack` is for). So the
//   question "what width gives a balanced block" has a closed form, and it is the
//   classic one: for area A and target aspect ratio R, `w = sqrt(A * R)`.
//
//   an aspect a balloon can hold. Slightly wider than tall - a speech balloon is
//   an oval whose major axis is horizontal, and text set squarer than that hits
//   the curve at the top and the bottom while leaving the middle empty. 1.6 is
//   inside the range letterers actually set to and comfortably clear of both
//   degenerate ends.

  // leaves a ragged remainder, so a width of exactly `total / n` reliably breaks
  // into n+1 lines rather than n. A few percent of headroom is what makes the
  // closed form's answer come true when the real breaker runs.

// The number of lines that makes a block of this much text closest to

// Derivation, so the two square roots are not magic: with `n` lines the block is
// `total / n` wide and `n * lineHeight` tall, so its aspect is
// `total / (n^2 * lineHeight)`. Setting that equal to R and solving for n gives
// `n = sqrt(total / (lineHeight * R))`, which is the same statement as
// `w = sqrt(total * lineHeight * R)` - the area form - with the line count made
// explicit. The line count is what has to be an integer, so it is the one that

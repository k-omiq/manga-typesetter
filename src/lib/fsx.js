// The rename below makes the write ATOMIC - the target holds the old contents or
// the new, never a mix. It does not make it DURABLE: the temp file's bytes and
// the rename both sit in the page cache, and a power cut or a kernel panic in
// that window can replay the rename against a temp file whose data never landed,
// which is a chapter.json of the right length full of zeroes. Both halves are
// flushed instead: the file before the rename, the directory after it.
//
// Best-effort by construction. There is no filesystem plugin API for this, so it
// goes through a command of our own (`fsync_path` in src-tauri), and everywhere
// that command does not exist - the browser dev server, the test runner, an
// older shell - this is a no-op and the write is exactly as durable as it was
// before. A failure is never allowed to fail the write: the bytes are on their
// way to the disk either way, and refusing the save would be the larger harm.
//
// Bounded, and that bound is the whole of the freeze this used to be. `fsync(2)`
// on a wedged volume - a cloud-sync folder whose daemon has stopped answering, a
// network share that has gone away without dropping the mount - does not fail,
// it BLOCKS, for as long as the volume takes to come back. Every write here
// makes two of those calls, the autosave chain in library.svelte.js awaits them
// one save at a time, and an unbounded wait therefore stops the queue for good:
// the app goes on accepting edits and never writes another byte, with no error
// anywhere to say so.
//
// So a sync that has not answered inside `fsyncTimeoutMs` is abandoned and the
// write carries on WITHOUT it. What is given up is durability across a power cut
// in that window, which is what the platform was already refusing to provide.
// What is kept is the property that actually protects the file: the temp file
// plus the rename is atomic whether or not either half was flushed, so the
// target still holds the old contents or the new and never a mix. The abandoned
// call is left to finish on its own - there is no cancelling a syscall in
// flight - and its result is dropped.

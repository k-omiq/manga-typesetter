// ===== Balloon interior recovery =====
//
// A text box placed on a bubble is currently sized from the detector's text
// block — the rectangle the *Japanese* occupied. That rectangle is wrong twice
// over. The Japanese in most balloons is set vertically, so the block is a tall
// narrow column exactly where the English wants a wide short one; and a bounding
// box says nothing about the balloon's shape, so English laid out inside it runs
// into the curve of an oval near the top and the bottom, which is the one place
// a letterer's eye goes first.
//
// The detector cannot help — `/analyze` reports `box`, `vertical` and
// `font_size` and nothing about the balloon — but the page can. A manga balloon
// is a solid light interior inside a dark outline, which is the one piece of
// structure that is true of nearly every bubble ever drawn, and a flood fill
// from inside the text block recovers it with no model, no network call and no
// change to the Python side.
//
// The module is deliberately split in two.
//
//   the pixel half   `fillInterior` — the only function here that touches an
//                    image. It takes an `ImageData`-shaped object, so the caller
//                    decides where the pixels came from (the canvas, an
//                    offscreen decode of `p.cleaned ?? p.raw`, a test fixture).
//   the geometry     everything else — profile, classify, fit, per-line widths,
//                    inscribed rect. Pure arithmetic on plain objects, testable
//                    under node with no canvas anywhere near it, and cheap
//                    enough that the line-breaker can call `interiorLineWidths`
//                    once per candidate line count inside its own search.
//
// What crosses the boundary between them is a mask; what crosses out of the
// module is a handful of numbers. That matters: the fitted shape is stored on
// the box, written into `chapter.json` and carried through the PSD's embedded
// project, so it has to be plain JSON — `{ kind:'ellipse', cx, cy, rx, ry }` or
// `{ kind:'rect', x, y, w, h }` — and never a mask.

// The knobs, and what each one is trading off. Every one of them is overridable
// per call, because a page of tiny four-panel gag strips and a page of splash
// art are not the same problem and the caller may know which it has.

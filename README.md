</div>

A desktop app that puts translated lettering into speech balloons. Light on
memory, works over hundreds of pages, no Photoshop needed.

**[Download](https://typesetter.komiq.cc)** · **[User guide (HOWTO)](HOWTO.md)**

> Public beta. In daily use, but expect rough edges.

## Recommended use

Translators work in **translate** mode: translate each bubble and tag it
(tagging shortcuts are still in progress). Typesetters then set a font per tag,
place the text boxes, and tune them. Auto placement can be turned off.

## Features

- Text box detection and auto placement
- **Tags**, so you stop scrolling the font list for every line. Tags are saved
  per project, so the first tagging pass is the slow one
- Auto fit to balloon. It is flaky, so it can be turned off in Settings, or per
  bubble with a shortcut
- Autosave
- Bulk restyle by tag or by selection, for when you change your mind
- Effects: transform (warp), stacked strokes and shadows, text clipping
  (untested), circular curve, arc, a controllable curve for wavy text, motion
  blur and normal blur, font roughening, text mask clipping
- Fills: solid, pattern and gradient (a better colour picker is in progress)
- The normal layout controls you expect
- Export to PNG, JPG, WebP or JSON, per page or per chapter
- Auto updates
- Low resource use, with heavy offloading to disk

> **Do not use PSD export yet.** It is unfinished, and low priority, because it
> is genuinely hard.

## Install

Grab the installer from **<https://typesetter.komiq.cc>**.

- macOS (Apple Silicon): open the `.dmg`, drag the app to Applications. The
  bundle is not notarised yet, so first launch needs right-click > **Open**.
- Windows: run the setup `.exe`.
- Linux (x86_64): two downloads. Install the `.deb`, or mark the `.AppImage`
  executable and run it. Both use your distro's GTK 3 and WebKitGTK 4.1
  (the `.deb` pulls them in; the AppImage tells you the install command if
  they are missing: `libwebkit2gtk-4.1-0` on Debian and Ubuntu,
  `webkit2gtk4.1` on Fedora, `webkit2gtk-4.1` on Arch).
  - `linux-x86_64` needs glibc 2.39 or newer: Ubuntu 24.04, Mint 22, Fedora
    39, Debian 13, Arch, or anything newer. On an older distro it refuses to
    start with `version 'GLIBC_2.39' not found`, and there is no build that
    does: the floor comes from the prebuilt ONNX Runtime, which is compiled
    against glibc 2.38 with or without a GPU feature. Reaching Ubuntu 22.04 or
    Debian 12 would take a Flatpak, which carries its own runtime.
  - It is one download whether or not the machine has a GPU. Detection uses
    WebGPU over Vulkan when a usable driver is there and the CPU when it is
    not.

  `ldd --version` prints your glibc version.

Updates arrive in-app and are signature-verified. Each Linux build only
updates to its own kind.

## Build from source

Requires [Node](https://nodejs.org) 20+ and a [Rust toolchain](https://rustup.rs)
(see the [Tauri v2 prerequisites](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/)).

```sh
git clone https://github.com/k-omiq/manga-typesetter.git
cd manga-typesetter
npm install

npm run tauri dev     # run it
npm run tauri build   # bundle in src-tauri/target/release/bundle
npm test              # vitest
```

Detection models download on first use and are cached under your home
directory; nothing ships in the bundle.

### GPU

Detection and OCR run on the GPU where one is usable, falling back to CPU per
model, and the settings dialog names the device in use:

- macOS: CoreML.
- Windows: CUDA on NVIDIA machines with CUDA 13 and cuDNN 9 installed,
  otherwise DirectML (any GPU, nothing to install).
- Linux: WebGPU over Vulkan (any GPU, nothing to install), CPU when there is
  no usable driver. An NVIDIA-only CUDA build exists for people with CUDA 13 +
  cuDNN 9, and is faster than WebGPU on those machines:

  ```sh
  npm run tauri build -- --features gpu-cuda --config src-tauri/tauri.linux-cuda.conf.json
  ```

  Plain `cargo build` on Linux has no GPU provider; pass `--features gpu-webgpu`
  or `gpu-cuda`, not both. The WebGPU feature only links on a host with glibc
  2.38+ and GCC 13's libstdc++ (Ubuntu 24.04 or newer).

Set `MT_DEVICE=cpu` (or `cuda`, `directml`, `webgpu`, `coreml`) before
launching to pin a device when a driver misbehaves. The first device probe
runs in a helper copy of the app (`app --probe-device`), so a driver that
aborts while starting up only kills that helper; detection then stays on CPU
for the rest of the run and the log says why.

On Linux the app switches WebKit's DMA-BUF renderer off when the NVIDIA
proprietary driver is loaded (a blank window otherwise). Set
`WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=0` before launching to force it back on; the
app leaves the variable alone when it is already set.

The AppImage bundles no GTK or WebKit on purpose: it uses the host's, exactly
like the `.deb`, so WebKit's UI process and its helper processes are always the
same version on every distro. `scripts/build-appimage.sh` explains why.
